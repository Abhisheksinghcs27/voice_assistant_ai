## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- macOS (for best compatibility with system applications)
- Microphone access
- Internet connection

### Step 1: Clone or Download
```bash
# If you have this as a repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd voice_assistant_ai

# Or navigate to the project directory
cd voice_assistant_ai
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Install PyAudio (if needed)
On macOS, you might need to install PyAudio separately:
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install portaudio
pip install PyAudio

# Or using conda
conda install pyaudio
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)
For enhanced AI features, create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp env_example.txt .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage (No API Key Required)
```bash
python simple_assistant.py
```

### Advanced Usage (With OpenAI API)
```bash
python main.py
```

### Command Examples

#### Voice Commands
- "What time is it?"
- "Open calculator"
- "Search for Python programming"
- "Weather in New York"
- "Create a note"
- "Play music"
- "Send email"
- "Calculate 15 plus 27"
- "Set reminder to call mom"

#### Text Commands
You can also type commands in the text input field:
- "open safari"
- "search for machine learning"
- "what's the date today"
- "weather in London"

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py                 # Full-featured assistant with OpenAI integration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simple_assistant.py     # Basic assistant without API requirements
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assistant_modules.py    # Modular command processing system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ env_example.txt         # Environment variables template
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ notes/                 # Directory for saved notes (created automatically)
```

## Architecture

### Modular Design
The assistant uses a modular architecture where each capability is implemented as a separate module:

- **WebSearchModule**: Handles web search commands
- **ApplicationModule**: Manages application launching
- **TimeDateModule**: Provides time and date information
- **NoteModule**: Handles note creation and management
- **WeatherModule**: Provides weather information
- **CalculatorModule**: Performs mathematical calculations
- **MusicModule**: Controls music applications
- **EmailModule**: Handles email-related tasks
- **ReminderModule**: Manages reminders and tasks
- **SystemModule**: Controls system settings

### Adding Custom Modules
To add a new capability, create a new class that inherits from `AssistantModule`:

```python
class CustomModule(AssistantModule):
    def can_handle(self, command):
        # Return True if this module can handle the command
        return 'custom' in command.lower()
    
    def execute(self, command, parameters=None):
        # Implement the command logic
        return "Custom response"
```

Then add it to the `ModuleManager` in `assistant_modules.py`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. PyAudio Installation
If you encounter issues installing PyAudio:
```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew install portaudio
pip install PyAudio

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio
```

#### 2. Microphone Access
Ensure your application has microphone permissions:
- macOS: System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Microphone
- Windows: Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Microphone

#### 3. Speech Recognition Issues
- Check your internet connection (required for Google Speech Recognition)
- Ensure your microphone is working and properly configured
- Try speaking clearly and in a quiet environment

#### 4. OpenAI API Errors
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your OpenAI account balance
- Ensure you have proper API access

### Performance Tips
- Use a good quality microphone for better speech recognition
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Minimize background noise
- Close unnecessary applications to free up system resources

## Customization

### Changing Assistant Name
Edit the `assistant_name` variable in the assistant class:
```python
self.assistant_name = "Your Custom Name"
```

### Adjusting Speech Settings
Modify speech rate and volume:
```python
self.engine.setProperty('rate', 150)    # Speed (words per minute)
self.engine.setProperty('volume', 0.9)  # Volume (0.0 to 1.0)
```

### Adding New Applications
Edit the `apps` dictionary in `ApplicationModule`:
```python
self.apps = {
    'your_app': 'Your Application Name',
    # ... existing apps
}
```
